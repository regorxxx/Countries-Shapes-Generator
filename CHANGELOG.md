## [Unreleased][]
### Added
- Main function now also allows to set 'countryColor' and 'mapColor' for the country shapes and shapes map respectively.
- printShapes and printShapesMap functions now also allow to set 'background', by default equal to None (transparent). Set it to a color array to create images with a color background for masking.
### Changed
- Target path is checked on all functions, and created if needed -and any intermediate-level directory-. It was only checked on the main function before.
